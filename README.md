Sign to text, text to Voice


As communication plays a very important role in human society, itâ€™s very difficult for people with speech issues (Mute people) to communicate with ordinary people. Sign language plays a vital role here as it uses the hand and body gestures for communication. But due to its learning difficulty and it not being very common, it is difficult for ordinary people to understand it. So, to overcome this issue, there is a need for a system which can translate the sign language into speech(voice). In this proposed system, the dataset of hand gesture images for A-to-Z letters is collected. Also, a custom gesture dataset for common day to day sentences is generated. Then the dataset is been through image preprocessing which made images ready for further feature extraction. Images are converted into grayscale images. As binary images contain minimum data, they are considered as an input for model. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for the classification of the input. The output given by the model is converted to audio using python libraries. Also, a user-friendly UI is added in the system for people to easily interact with system.
